This script is to help uploaders set the whitelist quickly and simply.

Click on the respective icon and add a new script.

Tampermonkey:
	Copy and paste the contents of the .js into the edit box that comes up.
	Save and test by reloading the page.
Greasemonkey:
	Click on the icon then New User Script.
	Give it a name (Zilths aewsome bulk name adder would be nice ;P)

Find the new button "Bulk Add' just before the Do It/Edit it! Button.
Praise Zilth :P



How it works:
It grabs all the available members names and id's and sticks them in an array.

When you click the 'Bulk Add' button it will ask for a (case insensitive) whitespace delimitered name list.
Press Ok on a blank box to end the prompt and process the names.

it will then find each name in the array and move it to the Exclusive Users list.

It will show how many names have been added.
it will also show below the form any names which were not found.


Tested in Firefox

Enjoy!

Zilth.
